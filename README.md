# TCL
This folder contains some TCL scripts that can be used with Cisco EEM.
I have tested the scripts on Cisco ISR. May need some modification to run on other firmwares.

These are just my take on TCL and I am sure they can be modefied further. I will try to refine, if I ever get time to revisit them. :)
